## Design System

Theme is defined in tailwind.config.js.
Text color is defined in global.css and applied to the body element.

Design system component documentation can be viewed with Storybook `npm run storybook`

## Icons

We are using [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) SVG icons with the [React library](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons#react) to get them as React Components.
Heroicon icons are made in two variants, solid or outline. We are using the outline variant.

## Class concatenation

We are using the `clsx` package to concatenate class names
