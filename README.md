# Damien Monni - Javascript freelance full-stack web developer üë®‚Äçüíª

This is my personal website as a javascript full-stack web developer.
This website is about the services I provide, the skills I have and my previous experiences.

![Damien Monni website](public/img/readme-thumbnail.png)

This is a **React** and **Typescript** based website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), one of the most popular React Framework.

This website uses the following libraries:

- React
- Next.js
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Storybook
- Jest
- Playwright

## Running locally in development mode

If you want to run this website locally in development mode:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

`git clone https://github.com/damien-monni/damien-monni.git`

2. Install dependencies

```
cd damien-monni
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

`npm run dev`

You should be able to access the application locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build and deploy

The way you build and deploy the website depends on your needs and is covered in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).

## Continous Integration (CI)

There is a GitHub Action configuration file in `.github/workflows` that can be used in a CI system.

## File structure

Source code is located in the `./src` directory.

In this directory, you will find a `pages` directory containing the website pages entry points. A special `_app.tsx` file exports a React component to initialize every page of this website ([more on this here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app)).

All React components are located in the `./src/components` directory and groupped by feature.

## Design System

The design system represents all the reusable components you can use to maintain a consistent UI over this website and to simplify the development experience.

Those reusable components can be found in a special directory `./src/design-system`.

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to build and document those components. To open and browse them, run the `npm run storybook` command. This will open Storybook in your browser and you will be able to see all the Design System reusable components.

## Tailwind CSS

We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework providing CSS classes to be used directly in our HTML.

Tailwind CSS does **not** provide ready to use components but only translates CSS rules from CSS files to HTML files.

Our website styling theme is defined in tailwind.config.js and `./src/styles/global.css`.

## Icons

We are using [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) SVG icons with the [React library](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons#react) to get them as React Components.
Heroicon icons are made in two variants, solid or outline. We are using the outline variant.

## CSS classes concatenation

To improve code visiblity and maintenance, we are using the `clsx` package to concatenate class names when there are multiple CSS classe inputs to attach to a particular HTML element.

For example, if you want to attach a component internal string class and props string class to a HTML element, you can do it like so:

```javascript
export default function MyComponent(props) {
  const { className } = props;

  return <button className={clsx('font-bold', className)}>A button</button>;
}
```
